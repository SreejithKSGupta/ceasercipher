# Caesar Cipher Toolkit

The Caesar Cipher Toolkit is a simple and intuitive web application designed to help users encode and decode messages using the Caesar Cipher technique. This classical encryption method shifts the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.

## Features

- **Encode Messages:** Convert plain text into encoded messages by shifting letters.
- **Decode Messages:** Decode messages back into plain text by reversing the shift.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface with clear input fields and buttons.

## Technologies Used

- **Sveltekit:** Lightning fast and userfriendly framework for webapps.
- **vercel:** easy and convinient hosting.
- **JavaScript:** Logic for encoding and decoding messages.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sreejithksgupta/caesercipher.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd caesercipher
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to start using the toolkit.

## Usage

1. Open the [Caesar Cipher Toolkit](https://ceasercipher.vercel.app/).
2. Select whether you want to encode or decode a message.
